---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- **Home Assistant** installation
- **Siemens S7 PLC** (S7-1200/1500/300/400) reachable over ISO-on-TCP (port 102)
- Network connectivity between Home Assistant and PLC

> ℹ️ For S7-1200/1500: Ensure data blocks have **Optimized block access disabled** if using absolute addressing.

### Installation

**Via HACS (Recommended)**

1. Ensure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) is installed
2. Open **HACS → Integrations**
3. Search for **"Siemens S7 PLC"** and install
4. Restart Home Assistant

**Manual Installation**

1. Copy `custom_components/s7plc` to your HA config directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

### Basic Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for **"S7 PLC"**
3. Choose connection type:
   - **Rack/Slot** (default): Standard connection for most PLCs
   - **TSAP**: For specific configurations or legacy systems
4. Enter PLC connection details:
   - Host, Port
   - Rack/Slot (typically `0/1` for S7-1200/1500, `0/2` for S7-300/400)
   - or Local/Remote TSAP for TSAP mode
5. Configure timeout and retry settings for your network
6. Add entities through **Configure** → **Add items**

## FAQ

**Q: Is MQTT required?**  
A: No. Direct S7 protocol communication to PLC.

**Q: Which PLCs are supported?**  
A: Any S7 PLC with ISO-on-TCP (port 102) support: S7-1200, S7-1500, S7-300, S7-400, Logo! 8.

**Q: Can I write values to the PLC?**  
A: Yes. `switch`, `light`, `dimmer light`, `cover`, `button`, `number`, `text`, `climate`, and Entity Sync all support writes.

**Q: Do I need to know PLC programming?**  
A: Basic knowledge helps. You need to know your data block structure and addresses.

**Q: Can I use symbolic names?**  
A: No, only absolute addressing (DB + offset) is supported.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- **Connection fails**: Check network, firewall, rack/slot values
- **Wrong values**: Verify address, data type, alignment
- **Slow updates**: Adjust scan interval, check network latency
- **Intermittent disconnects**: Review timeout settings, network stability

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for complete solutions.
